    content:
      "Many people confuse donkeys with mules, but they're quite different! A donkey is a separate species (Equus asinus), while a mule is a hybrid - the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse. Donkeys are smaller, have longer ears, and possess unique personalities that set them apart.",
    facts: [
      'Donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64, and mules have 63',
      'Mules are typically sterile and cannot reproduce',
      'Donkeys are more independent thinkers than horses',

      'Donkeys have been working alongside humans for over 5,000 years! They were first domesticated in ancient Egypt and became essential to the development of trade routes, agriculture, and transportation. The famous Silk Road relied heavily on donkeys to carry goods across vast distances.',

    content:
      'Scientific studies have shown that donkeys have exceptional memory and intelligence. They can remember places and other donkeys they knew over 25 years ago! Their cautious nature, often mistaken for stubbornness, is actually careful assessment - they think before they act.',
    facts: [
      'Can recognize and remember individual faces for decades',

      'Their "stubbornness" is actually intelligent self-preservation',

                Incredible Vision
              </h4>
              <p>
                Donkeys can see all four of their feet at the same time! Their eyes are positioned
                on the sides of their head, giving them nearly 360-degree vision.

                Desert Adaptations
              </h4>
              <p>
                Donkeys evolved in desert environments and can survive on minimal water. They can
                lose up to 30% of their body weight in water and still function normally.

              <p>
                With proper care, donkeys can live 30-50 years! Some have even reached 60 years old,
                making them long-term companions.

              <p>
                The famous donkey "hee-haw" bray can be heard up to 3 kilometers away! They use
                different sounds to communicate various emotions and needs.

                Natural Protectors
              </h4>
              <p>
                Donkeys have a natural instinct to protect their herd. They're often used as
                livestock guardians, defending sheep and goats from predators.
